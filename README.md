# TreasureHunt
This is my first mini progrma on maze problem in which we have to find the path to get to the treasure. We will be given a text file in which "@"
will be the treasure, "-" will be the path and "#" will be the wall. We have to read the file and find the best path to reach the treasure.
For better understanding please read the A2.PDF. The sample map is given below.
